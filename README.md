# Food Tracker

How can I stop my cat from getting fat? The solution? A food tracker. With the food tracker, it'll tell you when wet food has been fed to your cat and when dry food has been fed
as well. It also informs you what time the wet food or dry food hae been fed, so you can ensure you're not overfeeding your cat in a couple hour time span. 

# Dependencies
 - Express
 - Date-and-time (used for properly formatting)
 
# Disclaimer
This uses a local JSON file to store the information, like the dates and times of when the food is given, because I didn't see a need to put it on a database if I was gonna be the
only one using this. Also, there isn't much information to store anyways. 

# Coming Features
 - Total weight of the cat
 - How much food is left between dry and wet food
 - Disclaimer when trying to feed dry food in a 12 hour or less time window
 - SMS whenever wet food or dry food is given
 
Everyone is always arguing over who's fed the cat when and fed what, so hopefully this mediates all problems
